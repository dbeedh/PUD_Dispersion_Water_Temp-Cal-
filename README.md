# PUD Water Temperature Calculator

This dashboard helps calculate the correct mix of chilled and towns water to achieve the optimal temperature for polyurethane dispersion (PUD) processes.

## ⚠️ Critical Warning
Target temperature above **18°C** may cause dispersion failure and result in a cottage cheese texture.

## ✅ Optimal Range
Ideal target temperature: **15°C**
