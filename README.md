# PUD Water Temperature Calculator

This dashboard helps calculate the correct mix of chilled and towns water to achieve the optimal temperature for polyurethane dispersion (PUD) processes.

## ⚠️ Critical Warning
Target temperature above **18°C** may cause dispersion failure and result in a cottage cheese texture.

## ✅ Optimal Range
Ideal target temperature: **15°C**

## 📐 Formula

Where:
- `x` = Volume of chilled water required (litres)
- `T1` = Chilled water temperature
- `T2` = Towns water temperature
- `T3` = Target temperature
- `V3` = Total volume required

## 🧪 Usage Instructions
1. Measure the temperatures of chilled and towns water.
2. Enter the target temperature and total volume required.
3. Use the formula to calculate the required volumes.
4. Ensure the temperature probe is fully submerged and centered in the IBC.
